# Learning C#

I am a Java certified developer, hence I mainly worked with Java. 
As a developer I like to continue to learn new things, it is time for me to learn 
the C# (C Sharp, not C Hash) language.
So... I am reading [this](http://www.csharpcourse.com/) book, and I will put in this repo all the exercises that 
I will do.

## Book exercises

### Chapter 01
- No exercises, it was just an introduction

### Chapter 02
- My first C# program
- **Notes**
  - The file name of the source code does not need to match the class name like in Java. But it is a convention to make it match
  - I can define strings using the UNICODE code, for example: "\x0041" is equal to "A". If I don't want to escape the string I can do @"\x0041", this will print \x0041. the @"" is called verbatim string
  - You can use the verbatim character to write a string on multiple lines
  
        @"The quick
        brown fox
        jumps over the lazy dog"
